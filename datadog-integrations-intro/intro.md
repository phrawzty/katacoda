Welcome to the Introduction to Datadog Integrations course!

This course is based on the [official integrations documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/developers/integrations/new_check_howto/) and is meant to act as a fun and interactive way to get started with Datadog integrations.

This course is self-contained, so you don't need to worry about your local machine or existing development environment. Your enrollment in this course also included an invitation to a special _organisation_ specific to this course. Now would be a good time to accept the invitation to that organisation‚Äîgo ahead, I'll wait‚Ä¶
