There are a number of configuration files and formats. The most obvious is `config.yaml`, which is used to configure the integration itself. If you've ever configured a Datadog Agent integration in the past, you've likely encountered such a file. Beyond that, there exists a motley assortment of files that serve other purposes within the larger Datadog ecosystem—and don't worry if YAML isn't your thing, because we'll be looking at JSON and CSV files too! 😉

All of the files need to be present and populated in order for the integration to be accepted "upstream", which is to say, in the Datadog integrations extras repository, so it's important to be aware of these files. The [Introduction to Integrations](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/integrations/) section in the official Datadog documentation is an excellent resource, so feel free to open and bookmark that page right now.

With that now said, let's move along!
