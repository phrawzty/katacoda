One of the developer toolkit features is the `create` command, which creates the basic file and path structure (or "scaffolding") necessary for a new integration. Let’s try a dry-run using the -n/--dry-run flag, which won’t write anything to disk:
```
ddev create -n awesome | head -n 2
```{{execute}}

This will show you the directory where the scaffolding will be generated, as well as the name of the new integration (in this case: `awesome`). Ok, that looks good, so let's run it for real this time:
```
ddev create -n awesome
```{{execute}}

This will ask you some basic questions and then create the scaffolding right where we expect it to be.
